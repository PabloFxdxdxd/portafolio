                I just need someone in my life to give it structure
                To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
                You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
                You're saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
                Giving me love when you are down and need another
                I've gotta get away and let you go, I've gotta get over
            </p>

                This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
                I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
                'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
                So, please let me go
